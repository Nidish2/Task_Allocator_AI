1️⃣ Solution Approach
Our solution focuses on automatic task allocation using AI, ensuring fair workload distribution among team members based on their skills and availability. The system takes a list of tasks and available team members, then uses a machine learning model (Hugging Face API) to determine the best match for each task. This improves efficiency and optimizes team performance.

2️⃣ Implementation Details
Frontend: Built using React.js for a dynamic and user-friendly UI.

Backend: Developed using Express.js to handle API requests.

Database: MongoDB for storing tasks, team members, and allocations.

AI Integration: Uses Hugging Face Inference API for intelligent task assignment.

Version Control: GitHub for project collaboration and tracking changes.

3️⃣ Execution Steps
Clone the Repository

sh

Edit
npm install
Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file and add your MongoDB URL and Hugging Face API token:

ini
Copy
Edit
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
Start the Backend Server

sh
Copy
Edit
npm run server
Run the Frontend

sh

npm start
4️⃣ Dependencies
Node.js & npm – Required for running the project

Express.js – Backend framework for handling API requests

MongoDB & Mongoose – Database for storing task allocations

Hugging Face API – AI model for smart task allocation

React.js – Frontend framework for UI development

5️⃣ Expected Output
Task Allocation: Users can add tasks, and the system will automatically assign them based on skillset.

Manual Overrides: Users can edit task assignments manually if needed.

Database Storage: All tasks and allocations are stored and retrieved from MongoDB.

User-Friendly Interface: A React-based dashboard will display tasks and their assigned team members.
